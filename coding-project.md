# Coding project - Testing addresses CRUD on Sortly UI
Sortly provides a simple UI for customers to manage their addresses.  Please try out the UI for the same at  https://app-qa.sortly.co/company-addresses with the credentials provided to you.

## Automation Project
The primary goal of this project is to write automation tests for the UI of CRUD functionality of the addresses for a user with an “owner” role.  A user with an “owner” role has full CRUD permissions on addresses. 

Write the UI tests for this feature with a framework of your choice (Selenium/Playwright is preferred but we are open to any other framework of your choice).  Please commit the code to the git repository that is shared with you

Stretch goal: You can optionally expand the scope to test the restrictions on address functionality for users with a “Team Member” role.  A user with “Team Member” role has only READ permissions on addresses.

## Guidelines
* Please write modular and readable test code like you would normally do
* Commit your code periodically (instead of waiting for the final code) and push to git with comments.  This will help us in understanding your thought process & your way of coding in addition to the final code.
* Please add a readme on how to run the tests and also add your tests results output in a results folder (for reference)
